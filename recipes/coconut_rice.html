    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This coconut rice recipe is so simple and delicious, 
        it’ll quickly become a go-to in your side dish rotation. 
        While coconut rice can be found across the Asian 
        continent and throughout the Pacific, this recipe takes 
        inspiration from a traditional Malaysian recipe called Nasi lemak. 
        Countries like Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia all have similar 
        versions of coconut milk rice, so you can really explore the 
        different ways to make it.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can light or full-fat 
            coconut milk, well shaken and stirred</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place rice in a fine mesh strainer, and 
            rinse with cold water, stirring rice using 
            your fingers to remove excess starch, 
            until water from rice runs clear, about 1 
            minute.</li>
        <li>Place rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, 
            sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan; 
            stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture in saucepan to a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, undisturbed, for 11 minutes. Turn off heat; steam, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncover and gently stir in coconut oil.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
